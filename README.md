# Deep Homography Estimation for Dynamic Scenes
We address the problem of estimating homography for images with dynamic scenes by introducing a mask-augmented homography estimation network and a dynamics scene video dataset used to train the network. We demonstrate that our dataset is useful to enable training a deep learning based homography estimation to handle dynamic scenes. We also demonstrate that our proposed mask-augmented network dedicatedly designed for these scenes can further improve the performance of homography estimation quantitatively and qualitatively.
